* Add a module to detect argument misspellings and offer correction
* Add inquirer support
* Add proper logging module
* Write unit test in jest
* Refactor code into smaller functions (while writing unit tests)
* Change config/data.json to sqlite db?
* Implement the google translate bit so that those do not need to be manually determined (but make sure cached to avoid too many api calls during testing in data.json/sql)
* Maybe implement yahoo even though it is "powered by bing" to see if their interface permits for more results
